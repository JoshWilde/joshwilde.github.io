title: "Detecting gravitational lenses using machine learning: exploring interpretability and sensitivity to rare lensing configurations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper is about using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify strong gravitational lenses in simulated data. The CNN is applied to simulated compound gravitational lenses, and applied to HST imaging of four known compound gravitational lenses. The trained CNN is investigated to attempt to gain an understanding of what features the CNN has learnt.
